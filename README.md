A static, multi-page website built to represent the **Apostolic Church of Ethiopia (ACE)** and its affiliated content, including gospel music, preachings, and the **ACE Meklit** faith-based apparel and merchandise store.

The project integrates Christian values with modern web design, offering both spiritual content and a simple client-side shopping cart experience.
